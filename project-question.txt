I was wondering if using grid or flexbox is best practise? Or if it is case by case.

Also, I was wondering if I am overusing <div> rather than just using <article> or <aside> tags where possible? 
Through the process, I felt like I might be overcomplicating it by overusing <div> tags.

If you have any good resources on making styling look more professional, I'd really like to take a look.
I found when using the grid, since i wanted both columns to be the same size, alot of the spacing looks bad, I could 
not figure out how to make it look nicer.

I'd really appreicate your feed back if you have time!

Thank you for a great semester!

Best wishes, 

Jenna
