                <!--For company history, just the text portion was taken from wikipedia and condensed using AI: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singer_Corporation-->
                <p>Founded in 1851 as I. M. Singer & Co. by inventor Isaac M. Singer and New York lawyer Edward C. Clark, Singer became a pioneer in the development of practical sewing machines for household use. Singer’s early designs introduced key innovations such as the eye-pointed needle and lock stitch, helping establish the sewing machine as a reliable domestic tool</p>
                <p>In 1865, the company was renamed the Singer Manufacturing Company, reflecting its rapid growth and large-scale production capabilities. By 1860, Singer had become the world’s largest manufacturer of sewing machines, supported by its first major mass-production factory built in Elizabeth, New Jersey in 1863.</p>
                <p>Singer expanded internationally in the mid-19th century and gained global recognition after winning first prize at the Paris World’s Fair in 1855. Continued innovation followed, including the introduction of the vibrating shuttle sewing machine in 1885 and the first workable electric sewing machine in 1910. Singer also transformed consumer marketing by pioneering installment payment plans, making sewing machines accessible to households worldwide.</p>
                <p>Today, Singer Corporation remains one of the most recognized names in sewing, with its global headquarters located in Nashville, Tennessee.</p>
